# repo-exercise

## Usage
This python program takes in a word and prints it reversed. For example cars would result in srac.
```
word = input(prompt="Enter a word:") # takes in string input
new_word = "" # creates a variable to store the result
for letter in word: # loops through each letter
    new_word = letter + new_word # adds each letter to the front of the string
print(new_word) # prints result
```

We chose the code of conduct that we did because it convered a lot of important points. It is not too specific nor too vague so it will be sufficient as a guideline for this small project.

We chose the licence that we did because the code is very simple and could be written by anyone. There is no reason for anyone to use this code anyway.
